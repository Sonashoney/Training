<h3>Real Time Tools</h3>
<p>Just because a tool is the most popular doesn’t mean it’s the “best.” What’s best is always context-dependent in programming. However, popularity is an undeniably important metric when choosing between a handful of similar tools. It’s not the popularity itself that adds to a tool’s value; it’s the greater supply of resources and support from the larger community of a given tool.
